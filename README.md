# Front-end Interview Questions Handbook Flashcards

I decided that I wanted to study for these interview questions on the go, during commutes or while sitting in doctor's offices. So I make some flashcard decks in popular formats.

Thanks to [Yangshun's Front-end Interview Questions Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook) for the material.

Will be updated as more info is pushed.
